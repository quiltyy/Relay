Relay MDPT Position Submission

For the following data submissions I wanted to create a small README outlining the steps of the process for creating the data required by this task.

First and foremost I want to address the duplicate records from the dataset I created.  I felt that in the process of the task, these student I.D.s would need to be further investigated, and looking at their records it appeared to be a few students enrolled then renerolled, and another few whose school codes returned a number of results from the U.S. Department of Education’s API.  In both cases, I think a conversation about a students status, especially with the little information I was given 

In regards to the records with multiple returned school codes i.e. the Ponce Health Sciences University.  We would need to investigate which campus specifically the student attended, then adjust the record as necessary.
